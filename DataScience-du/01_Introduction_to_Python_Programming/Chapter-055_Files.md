Chapter 5.5 - Files
==

# Notes

- `open()` returns a file handle, which makes reading possible, it takes the file name and the mode.

- '\n' is the newline operator.

- you can use the for loop to read the file line by line.

- newlines are white spaces and strippable with `rstrip()`.

- if your except blows the entire program up, use `quit()` at the end of it to terminate the program.

- any process on a blank line explodes usually, so take case.

- any logical evaluation starts from the first condition.
