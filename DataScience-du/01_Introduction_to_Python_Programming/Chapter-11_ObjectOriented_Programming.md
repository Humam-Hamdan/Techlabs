# Chapter 11 - Object-oriented Programming
## Hey Techie,   
Welcome to the final notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/Objects. Today's four videos deal with concept of object-oriented programming. In the end, please try to solve the presented task. As PY4E does not offer an auto-graded assigment for this lecture, you can only double-check your results using the provided test cases.

## Have fun! :-)
