# Chapter 6 - Lists
### Hey Techie,   
Welcome to the sixth notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/lists. Today's three videos deal with how Python simplest data structure works - the list. There is no need to watch the video *Lists, Files, and the Guardian Pattern*. In the end, please try to solve the presented tasks. To do so, you need to understand how to open text files (.txt) in Python. Therefore, please read the following article: https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-read-text-file/. If you want to double-check your results, you may also upload them to PY4E. For that, a Google Account is required. On the website, you find the auto-graded code tasks at the very end of each lesson.

#### Have fun! :-)   
*Video length in total*: 30 minutes

# Notes

- A list has many variables, the syntax in python `list = [ 'item', 'item', 'item', 13, 3.14, [2.71, 6.24] ]`.

- for and lists are usually used together.

- strings are immutable.

- `len(list)` gives the number of items in a list.

- `range()` gives a list of numbers from zero and upto the number n-1 where n is the input.

- instead of looping over the list we loop over the range of the len of the list.

- the `+` can add lists.

- Slicing is the same as in strings, `list[start:end]`.

- you can define a list with `list = list()`, then you can append.

- you can also you the `in` logical operator.

- the `list.sort()` gives you a sorted list.

- there are a couple of functions that take a list as an input, such as `len(list)`, `min(list)`, `max(list)`, `sum(list)`

- the `string.split()` returns a list with every 'word' as an element.

- you can set the split item, i.e. `list.split(' split_key ')`.
