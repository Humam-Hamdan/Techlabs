    "# Chapter 7 - Dictionaries\n",
    "### Hey Techie,   \n",
    "Welcome to the seventh notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/dictionary. Today's three videos deal with dictionaries and how to use them to store key-value associations. There is no need to watch the video *Counting Word Frequency using a Dictionary*. In the end, please try to solve the presented task. If you want to double-check your results, you may also upload them to PY4E. For that, a Google Account is required. On the website, you find the auto-graded code tasks at the very end of each lesson.\n",

    "#### 1. Write a program to read through the data/mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.\n",
