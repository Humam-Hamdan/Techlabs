    "# Chapter 4 - Loops and Iterations\n",
    "### Hey Techie,   \n",
    "Welcome to the fourth notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/loops. Today's four videos deal with how Python repeats statements using looping structures. There is no need to watch the worked exercise. In the end, please try to solve the presented task. If you want to double-check your results, you may also upload them to PY4E. For that, a Google Account is required. On the website, you find the auto-graded code tasks at the very end of each lesson.\n",

    "#### 1. Write a program that repeatedly prompts a user for integer numbers until the user enters 'done'. Once 'done' is entered, print out the largest and smallest of the numbers. If the user enters anything other than a valid number catch it with a try/except and put out an appropriate message and ignore the number. Enter 7, 2, bob, 10, and 4 and match the output below.\n",
