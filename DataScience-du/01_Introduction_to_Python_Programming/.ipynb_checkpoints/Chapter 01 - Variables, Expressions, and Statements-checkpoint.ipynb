    "### Hey Techie,   \n",
    "Welcome to the first notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/memory. Today's two videos deal with variables and how we can use them to store data. There is no need to watch the worked exercises. In the end, please try to solve the presented task. If you want to double-check your results, you may also upload them to PY4E. For that, a Google Account is required. On the website, you find the auto-graded code tasks at the very end of each lesson.\n",
