# Chapter 3 - Functions
## Hey Techie,   
Welcome to the third notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/functions. Today's first two videos deal with functions and how we can make code reusable. A third video explains how anonymous functions, also called lambda functions, work which can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX6lWSp7pP4&list=PLkdX4MYXSiDubmajVt7ge9LDclDf7AfKK&index=3. There is no need to watch the worked exercise on PY4E. In the end, please try to solve the presented task. If you want to double-check your results, you may also upload them to PY4E. For that, a Google Account is required. On the website, you find the auto-graded code tasks at the very end of each lesson.

## Have fun! :-)

# Notes

- def defines a function

- def stores the code and reuses it.

- a function can have a set of input.

- Example for an argument

```python
def greet(lang):
    if land == 'en':
        print('en')
    # and so on
```

- return example

```python
def greet():
    return 'Hello'
print(greet(), 'Mike')
```

- do not push you luck with functions.
