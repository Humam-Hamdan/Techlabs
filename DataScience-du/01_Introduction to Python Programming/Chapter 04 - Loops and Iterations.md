# Chapter 4 - Loops and Iterations
## Hey Techie,   
Welcome to the fourth notebook of this Python tutorial series. We encourage you to take this notebook as a template to code along the instruction videos, which you may find at: https://www.py4e.com/lessons/loops. Today's four videos deal with how Python repeats statements using looping structures. There is no need to watch the worked exercise. In the end, please try to solve the presented task. If you want to double-check your results, you may also upload them to PY4E. For that, a Google Account is required. On the website, you find the auto-graded code tasks at the very end of each lesson.

## Have fun! :-)   
*Video length in total*: 45 minutes   
*Self-study time*: 45 minutes   
*Total*: **90 minutes**

# Notes

- while or for.

- while has a condition that works just like an if statement.

- a break breaks the current loop.

- a continue skips the rest of the loop and goes to the head again.

-whiles are indefinite loops, that means that they do not stop at a certain known point in time.

- a definite loop loops over a finite number of times depending on the item we use.

- `for i in ` is the base syntax for for loops.

- `while condition` is the syntax for while loops.

- for loop manages the iteration variable... Well, in C you do that tho.

- you can set a variable to `None` in which there is just nothing stored.

- `is` and `is not` compares not only values but also types.
