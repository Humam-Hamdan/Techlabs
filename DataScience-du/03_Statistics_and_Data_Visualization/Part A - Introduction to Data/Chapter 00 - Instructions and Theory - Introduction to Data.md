# Chapter 0 - Instructions and Theory - Introduction to Data
## Hey Techie,
Welcome to the first part of this statistics and data visualization tutorial series. This part serves as a kick-off to the field of statistics and data visualizations. After auditing the [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data), you may find the respective materials here: https://www.coursera.org/learn/understanding-visualization-data/home/week/1.   
As you will see, every part is always divided into three units of meaning:
1. You will watch videos and read materials that introduce you to essential concepts from a theoretical point of view.
2. You will learn how to apply these concepts in Python.
3. You can test your newly gained knowledge by solving practice tasks.   

For unit one, we will always provide you with a template that you may use to take notes. This template is always found in the week's respective *Chapter 00 - Instructions and Theory - ...* notebook. For unit two, you will find separate notebooks in every part's folder that you may work through (i.e., in this case, from Chapter 01 up to Chapter 04). These notebooks are the same as the ones you find on Coursera. For unit three, we will provide you with a notebook named *Chapter 99_Practice - ...* for every week respectively.   
   
*Unit 1*: 98 minutes   
*Unit 2*: 64 minutes   
*Unit 3*: 30 minutes   
*Total*: **192 minutes**   
   
### IMPORTANT NOTE: This part covers some concepts that are not new to you. Whenever you feel like you know a specific topic very precisely, feel free to skip it. Otherwise, these parts are a great opportunity for recapitulation.

#### Have fun! :-)
